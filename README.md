In previous studies, we conducted [clustering analysis (https://https://github.com/falahamro/Identity_mapping/blob/main/Final_Holistic_Identity_Mapping_domestic.ipynb). To better understand the semantic meaning of the obtained clusters, topic modeling based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied to the entire dataset. Topic modeling can discover hidden themes from text based on the semantic associations between words and provide abstract topics. These abstract topics can be used to construct meaning for our cluster classes and discover latent but distinctive behavioral patterns of DVEs from their discourse. First, we discuss the dominant topics for the entire dataset. This will serve as a baseline for subsequent comparison of how users in each of our cluster classes discuss these topics and determine whether there were any indications of divergent terms from the three clusters.
